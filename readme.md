#Ex5
.
This repository contains my own code required for implementing Ex5 from Machine Learning course of Andrews NG on regularized linear regression to predict the amount of water mowing out of a dam using the change of water level in a reservoir. The code also implement debugging learning algorithms based on learning curves and examine the effects of bias v.s. variance.
